                I developed my first real user interface during my senior design project in university.
                When I started, I had coding experience but none at all with JavaScript or front-end development.
                Then I was given the task to create a touchscreen GUI for the dashboard of an autonomous vehicle
                completely from scratch, in just a single semester. Once I figured out what I was doing, I was hooked.
                Since then I've made multiple personal projects, a Spotify guess the song game, word search solver,
                and this very website.

                In my free time, Iâ€™m often found working on various projects with my friends or playing
                video games with them. These days, I'm venturing into game development with one of them
                and exploring embedded software with another. I just really like coding.
