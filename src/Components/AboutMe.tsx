                I developed my first real user interface during my senior design project in university.
                When I started, I had coding experience but none at all with JavaScript or front-end development.
                Then I was given the task to create a touchscreen GUI for the dashboard of an autonomous vehicle
                completely from scratch, in just a single semester. Once I figured out what I was doing, I was hooked.
                Since then I've made multiple personal projects, including a daily browser game and a song guessing game.
                Each new project just leads to more excitement on what I could work on next.

                In my free time, Iâ€™m often found working on various projects alone or with my friends. These days,
                I'm venturing into game development with one of them and exploring embedded software with another.
                I just like to code.
